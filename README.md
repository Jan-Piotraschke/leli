# leli

What is **leli**? **leli** stands for "**le**gacy **li**terate".  
Its designed primarily to empower the use of the *AImM* (AI-maintained Microservices) architecture.  
**leli** prepares everything so that an AI can maintain and inspect compliant codebases by reading their HTML output files.  

Using **leli** is about coding with the end in mind: envisioning that your project will someday be a legacy project, which you yourself will not maintain anymore. But you want to ensure that the AI can maintain, explain, and customize it, understanding your literate words and thoughts behind it.

## Installation

Compile the project using the following command:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

or if you are on a Windows machine:

```bash
cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

If you are on a Windows machine please also install "Diesel" using the following command:

```bash
powershell -c "irm https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/releases/download/v2.2.1/diesel_cli-installer.ps1 | iex"
```

And please also install "Pandoc"

### Make *leli* available globally

If you are on a Unix-like system, you can use the following command:

```bash
rustc install.rs
./install
```

## Usage

```bash
./target/release/leli extract --file example/math_operations.md
```

or for a complete folder

```bash
./target/release/leli extract --folder example
```

If you code using the AImM protocol you should use the following command:

```bash
./target/release/leli extract --folder example --protocol AImM
```

If you want to create HTML files from the markdown files, you can use the following command:

```bash
./target/release/leli translate --folder example --css src/css/style.css
```

If you don't specify a CSS file, the default CSS of src/css/style.css will be used.  

If you want to save the meta data of the generated HTML files to a SQLite database, you can use the following command:

```bash
 ./target/release/leli save --file doc/created_html_files.txt --db mydatabase.db
```

or

```bash
 ./target/release/leli save --file doc/created_html_files.txt --db mydatabase.sqlite
```


## Development

If you develop on a macOS, please use **leli** for Windows cross-compilation using [wine](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/wine-stable) like this:

```bash
wine windows/leli.exe extract --folder example --protocol AImM
```

Simply add *wine* in front of the normal command.
